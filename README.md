The Javascript Tree

An exercise in Object Oriented Modeling in Javascript, an exploration of HTML Canvas and Turtle Graphics.

Our tree is the expression of two simple rules: (1) branches grow, and (2) branches branch.

It's a fractal â€” an image that contains instances of itself.

Our tree represents a recursive structure as a collection of objects.

Since the rules are applied recursively, slight changes in the rules can produce profound changes in the final result. In this regard, we are the same as our tree.

To grow the tree, clone down and open index.html
